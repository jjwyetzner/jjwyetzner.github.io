        <p>Hi - my name is JJ, and I am a rising sophomore at Yale University studying physics. I am interested in all things physics, mathematics, and computer science. I hope to pursue a career in quantum computing.</p>
        <p>I am currently working in Logan Wright's lab in Yale's Applied Physics department. My current project is developing methods of training stochastic neural networks to apply to optical neural networks opperating at small photon counts.</p>
        <p>I am a member of the Yale Society of Physics Students and Yale Undergraduate Quantum Computing Society. As a member of the latter, I had the opportunity to attend MIT's 2024 iQuHack Quantum Hackathon, where my team placd first! </p>
        <p>Outside of physics, I spend many hours a week playing trumpet in various ensembles. I also enjoy weightlifting and playing the daily New York Times games!</p>
